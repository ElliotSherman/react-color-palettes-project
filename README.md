# A Clone combination of FlatUIColors & MaterialUI Colors
Link to the Deployed project : https://elliotsherman.github.io/react-color-palettes-project/
thanks to github-pages
this project is based on React Course from Colt Steele on Udemy the only difference is that my version is
based on functional components and the course is based on Class componenets.

in addition i use react router dom V6 which is not covered in the course

## I have gained alot of knowledge from this project and it was really productive
